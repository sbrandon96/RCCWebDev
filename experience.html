                <h2>Computer Science</h2>
                <p class="experience">
                    Computer Science is a dynamic and rapidly evolving field that encompasses a wide range of topics and
                    skills.
                    During my studies, I have gained exprience in the following areas:
                </p>
                <h3>Software Development</h3>
                <p class="experience">
                    <img class="in-line-image2" src="assets/agile.png" alt="agile">
                    Software development is a critical component of Computer Science, involving the planning and
                    creation of software applications.
                    I have experience in designing software systems, including defining requirements, creating UML
                    diagrams, and developing
                    software architecture. I have a personal interest in the Agile methodology and have been personally
                    studying these fundamentals,
                    as they align directly with my philosophy regarding software development.
                </p>
                <h3>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h3>
                <p class="experience">
                    <img class="in-line-image" src="assets/OOP.png" alt="OOP">
                    Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can
                    contain data and code to manipulate that data.
                    I have experience in object-oriented programming languages like Java and Python, and have used OOP
                    principles to design software. I prefer this approach
                    to programming as it allows for more modular, maintainable, and scalable code. It is also easy for
                    outside developers to understand and work with. For more more
                    information on my Object Oriented Programming, check out <a

                    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of
                    algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions based on data.
                    I have experience in deploying machine learning algorithms for tasks such as statistical analysis,
                    pattern recognition, and predictive modeling. Using python and libraries like
                    Scikit-learn, I have been able to develop and deploy machine learning models. For more information
